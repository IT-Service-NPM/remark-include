With this plugin, you can use `::include{file=./included.md}`
[GitLab transclusion syntax](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/markdown/#includes)
statements to compose markdown files together.

Additional features:

- GitLab include directives inside the included file are ignored,
  but this plugin **support recursive transclusion**
- It is possible to use globs (`::include{file=./included*.md}`)
  in `file` attribute
- New attribute `optional`,
  which disable fatal directive error when file does not exists
- Relative images and links in the imported files will have their paths rewritten
  to be relative the original document rather than the imported file
  (with [`@it-service-npm/remark-relative-url-adjustment`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@it-service-npm/remark-relative-url-adjustment))
- An imported markdown file will “inherit” the heading levels.
  If the `::include{file=./included.md}` statement happens under Heading 2,
  for example, any heading 1 in the included file
  will be “translated” to have header level 3
  (with [`@it-service-npm/remark-heading-adjustment`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@it-service-npm/remark-heading-adjustment))

This plugin is a modern version of
[`remark-import`](https://github.com/BrekiTomasson/remark-import) plugin
and [`remark-include`](https://github.com/Qard/remark-include) plugin,
written in Typescript, and compatible with Remark v15.

There are two plugins: `remarkInclude` (preferred) and `remarkIncludeSync`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [`remark-directive`][] plugin expected before
> `@it-service-npm/remark-include`.
>
> This package provides two plugins presets:
>
> - `remarkIncludePreset`. This preset contains:
>
>   - `remarkInclude`
>   - `remarkDirective`
>   - `remarkHeadingsAdjustment`
>   - `remarkRelativeUrlsAdjustment`
>   - `remarkRelativeCodePathsAdjustment`
> - `remarkIncludePresetSync`. This preset contains:
>
>   - `remarkIncludeSync`
>   - `remarkDirective`
>   - `remarkHeadingsAdjustment`
>   - `remarkRelativeUrlsAdjustment`
>   - `remarkRelativeCodePathsAdjustment`

## Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev @it-service-npm/remark-include
```

## Examples

### Transclusion or including markdown sub-documents for reuse

`@it-service-npm/remark-include` can include sub-documents in markdown document.

> [!TIP]
> This plugin has two named entry points:
>
> - ‘sync’ ('@it-service-npm/remark-include/sync’)
> - ‘async’ ('@it-service-npm/remark-include/async’)
>
> With sync and async plugin function and preset.

Async plugin using example:

```typescript file=test/examples/01/example.ts
import { remark } from 'remark';
import * as vFile from 'to-vfile';
import { remarkIncludePreset } from '@it-service-npm/remark-include/async';
import type { VFile } from 'vfile';

export async function remarkDirectiveUsingExample(
  filePath: string
): Promise<VFile> {
  return remark()
    .use(remarkIncludePreset)
    .process(await vFile.read(filePath));
};

```

Source files:

main.md:

```markdown file=test/examples/01/fixtures/main.md
Hello. I am an main markdown file with `::include` directive.

::include{file=./included1.md}

After first file.

::include{file=./included2.md}

After second file.

_That_ should do it!

```

included1.md:

```markdown file=test/examples/01/fixtures/included1.md
Hello. I am the included1 file.

```

included2.md:

```markdown file=test/examples/01/fixtures/included2.md
Hello. I am the included2 file.

```

Remark output:

```markdown file=test/examples/01/snapshots/output.md
Hello. I am an main markdown file with `::include` directive.

Hello. I am the included1 file.

After first file.

Hello. I am the included2 file.

After second file.

*That* should do it!

```

### Recursive transclusion

`@it-service-npm/remark-include` support recursive transclusion.

> [!TIP]
> This plugin has two named entry points:
>
> - ‘sync’ ('@it-service-npm/remark-include/sync’)
> - ‘async’ ('@it-service-npm/remark-include/async’)
>
> With sync and async plugin function and preset.

Sync plugin using example:

```typescript file=test/examples/04/example.ts
import { remark } from 'remark';
import * as vFile from 'to-vfile';
import { remarkIncludePreset } from '@it-service-npm/remark-include/sync';
import type { VFile } from 'vfile';

export function remarkDirectiveUsingExample(
  filePath: string
): VFile {
  return remark()
    .use(remarkIncludePreset)
    .processSync(vFile.readSync(filePath));
};

```

Source files:

main.md:

```markdown file=test/examples/04/fixtures/main.md
Hello. I am an main markdown file with `::include` directive.

::include{file=./included1.md}

_That_ should do it!

```

included1.md:

```markdown file=test/examples/04/fixtures/included1.md
Hello. I am the included1 file with `::include` directive
for recursive transclusion example.

::include{file=./included2.md}

```

included2.md:

```markdown file=test/examples/04/fixtures/included2.md
Hello. I am the included2 file.

```

Remark output:

```markdown file=test/examples/04/snapshots/output.md
Hello. I am an main markdown file with `::include` directive.

Hello. I am the included1 file with `::include` directive
for recursive transclusion example.

Hello. I am the included2 file.

*That* should do it!

```

### Adjust the heading levels

`@it-service-npm/remark-include` adjust the heading levels within the included content.

Source files:

main.md:

```markdown file=test/examples/05/fixtures/main.md
# Main file

::include{file=./included1.md}

## H2 in main file

End of main file.

```

included1.md:

```markdown file=test/examples/05/fixtures/included1.md
# included1 file H1 (should be changed to H2 in output file)

Hello. I am the included1.

## in included1 file H2 (should be changed to H3 in output file)

::include{file=./included2.md}

## in included1 file after included2 H2 (should be changed to H3 in output file)

text text text.

```

included2.md:

```markdown file=test/examples/05/fixtures/included2.md

![Test local image](test-image.png)

![Test local image with space](test%20image.png)

![Test web image](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-repo-blue?logo=github)

```

Remark output:

```markdown file=test/examples/10/fixtures/output.md

![Test local image with space](subfolder1/test%20image.png)

![Test web image](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-repo-blue?logo=github)

*That* should do it!

```

### Updating relative path for code files

Relative images and links in the imported files will have their paths rewritten
to be relative the original document rather than the imported file.

Source files:

main.md:

```markdown file=test/examples/11/fixtures/main.md
Hello. I am an main markdown file with `::include` directive.

::include{file=./subfolder1/included.md}

_That_ should do it!

```

included.md:

````markdown file=test/examples/11/fixtures/subfolder1/included.md
Hello. I am the included. Test for code file path rebasing:

```typescript file=../../example.ts
import { remark } from 'remark';
import * as vFile from 'to-vfile';
import remarkDirective from 'remark-directive';
import { remarkInclude } from '@it-service-npm/remark-include';
import type { VFile } from 'vfile';

export async function remarkDirectiveUsingExample(
  filePath: string
): Promise<VFile> {
  return remark()
    .use(remarkDirective)
    .use(remarkInclude)
    .process(await vFile.read(filePath));
};

```

Code with file path with spaces and lines range:

```typescript file=code\ with\ spaces.ts#L11-L15
  return remark()
    .use(remarkDirective)
    .use([codeImport])
    .use(remarkInclude)
    .process(await vFile.read(filePath));
```

And code without file attribute:

```typescript
import { remark } from 'remark';
import * as vFile from 'to-vfile';
import remarkDirective from 'remark-directive';
import { remarkInclude } from '@it-service-npm/remark-include';
import type { VFile } from 'vfile';
```
