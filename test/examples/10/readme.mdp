# Updating relative path for links, images

Relative images and links in the imported files will have their paths rewritten
to be relative the original document rather than the imported file.

Source files:

main.md:

```markdown file=fixtures/main.md
Hello. I am an main markdown file with `::include` directive.

::include{file=./subfolder1/included.md}

_That_ should do it!
```

included.md:

```markdown file=fixtures/subfolder1/included.md
Hello. I am the included. Test image:

![Test local image](test-image.png)

![Test local image with space](test%20image.png)

![Test web image](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-repo-blue?logo=github)
```

Remark output:

```markdown file=fixtures/output.md
Hello. I am an main markdown file with `::include` directive.

Hello. I am the included. Test image:

![Test local image](subfolder1/test-image.png)

![Test local image with space](subfolder1/test%20image.png)

![Test web image](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-repo-blue?logo=github)

*That* should do it!
```
