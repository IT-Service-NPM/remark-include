# Transclusion or including markdown sub-documents for reuse

`@it-service-npm/remark-include` can include sub-documents in markdown document.

```typescript file=./example.ts
import { remark } from 'remark';
import * as vFile from 'to-vfile';
import { remarkIncludePreset } from '@it-service-npm/remark-include/sync';
import type { VFile } from 'vfile';

export async function remarkDirectiveUsingExample(
  filePath: string
): Promise<VFile> {
  return remark()
    .use(remarkIncludePreset)
    .process(await vFile.read(filePath));
};

```

Source files:

main.md:

```markdown file=fixtures/main.md
Hello. I am an main markdown file with `::include` directive.

::include{file=./included.md}

_That_ should do it!

```

```markdown file=fixtures/included.md
Hello. I am the included.
```

Remark output:

```markdown file=snapshots/output.md
Hello. I am an main markdown file with `::include` directive.

*That* should do it!

```
